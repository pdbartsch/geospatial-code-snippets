# geospatial-code-snippets
Examples, cookbook style snippets and notes on manipulating geospatial data using Python.  Since I work in both commercial software and open source software I'll be documenting both.  Most of these examples will be shared as Jupyter Notebooks.

# Highlights:
- [dd_pages_export.py](dd_pages_export.py) - Export one or all data driven pages to PDF from a choice of multiple input ArcGIS Desktop mxd maps.
